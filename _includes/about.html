                <p>Data Science, situated at the intersection of statistics, computer science and domain expert knowledge, is a rapidly growing field with unprecedented opportunities. Led by Dr. Linda H. Zhao, Wharton full professor and data science expert, the <b><i>Wharton Data Science Academy: Training Camp - Beijing</i></b> provides an opportunity for Chinese students to experience Wharton without having to travel thousands of miles. The training camp will empower and equip students with essential data science techniques, including but not limited to study design, data wrangling, data visualization, and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as modern regression and ensemble methods.  Students will gain transferable experience with <b>R</b>, a programming language widely used in both academia and industry, in a hands-on, accessible way. Along the journey, students will learn all concepts through real world case studies drawing from bioinformatics to the social sciences and beyond. To model the Wharton experience with maximum integrity, the program will be delivered in English by Professor Linda Zhao and her team of two teaching assistants.</p>
